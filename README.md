# Argetina_Inflation_Graph

The goal of the project is to show Argentina's increasingly volatile and severe inflation patters.

This project consists of webscraping, data analysis, and visualization. The scraper collects monthly inflation data from Argentina's Central Bank's official website. Next, the program analyzes the data by identifying the years of highest inflation according to the Sum of Square Residuals. Lastly, it graphs the average of Argentina's tamer years of inflation and the two most extreme years of inflation.
